# E-commerce Website

## Description
This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack web application designed to showcase the fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to handle basic data management tasks through a web interface, without aiming to build a fully functional website.


## Features

### User Registration

- **Register New Users**: Users can register by providing their first name, last name, email, and password. The user information is stored in a MongoDB database.
- **Form Validation**: Basic form validation ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly before submission.

### User Login

- **Admin Login**: Only admin users can log in. Admin credentials are hardcoded
  
### View Users

- **User List**: Admin can view a list of all registered users.
- **Detailed User Information**: Each user’s details, including first name, last name, email, and password, are displayed.

### Delete Users

- **Remove Users**: Admin can delete any user from the database.
- **Confirmation Prompt**: Ensures that users are not accidentally deleted by requiring confirmation.

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the website uses:

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js with Express:** Manages the backend and routes different HTTP requests. Node.js is chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for building scalable applications.
  - **MongoDB:** Used as the database to handle various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). MongoDB is a NoSQL database, providing flexibility and scalability for managing data.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React:** Employed for building the user interface. React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
  - **HTML & CSS:** Utilized for structuring and styling the frontend components.

- **Design:**
  - **Figma:** Used for UI/UX design to create visual representations and prototypes of the user interface.
