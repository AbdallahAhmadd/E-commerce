Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the website uses:

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js with Express:** Manages the backend and routes different HTTP requests. Node.js is chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for building scalable applications.
  - **MongoDB:** Used as the database to handle various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). MongoDB is a NoSQL database, providing flexibility and scalability for managing data.

- **Frontend:**
  - **React:** Employed for building the user interface. React is a JavaScript library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.
  - **HTML & CSS:** Utilized for structuring and styling the frontend components.

- **Design:**
  - **Figma:** Used for UI/UX design to create visual representations and prototypes of the user interface.
